# BELLY BUTTON BIODIVERSITY CHALLENGE

## Background:
The purpose of this respistory is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site. Which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## [Dashboard Navigation Link](file:///Users/siykee/Documents/GitHub/belly-button-challenge/index.html)
**Please** note that I've been having trouble with live server not working. It will just send me to a blank screen. Dashboard should either show up in the link or clicking on the index.html file itself.

## Instructions:
1) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
   - Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
   - Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
   - Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

2) Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
   - Use otu_ids for the x values.
   - Use sample_values for the y values.
   - Use sample_values for the marker size.
   - Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
   - Use otu_labels for the text values

3) Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
